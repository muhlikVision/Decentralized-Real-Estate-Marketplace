## About the Project

This project aims to bring transparency, security, and efficiency to real estate transactions by tokenizing properties on the blockchain and automating escrow processes. Leveraging blockchain, AI, and decentralized storage, the platform allows properties to be listed as NFTs, supports automated property price prediction, and enables seamless, trustless ownership transfer using smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **NFT Tokenization of Properties**: Each property is represented as an NFT, allowing for immutable ownership records on the blockchain.
- **AI-Powered Price Prediction**: Predicts property prices based on historical and current data.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Stores property metadata on IPFS, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
- **Automated Escrow and Ownership Transfer**: Utilizes smart contracts for secure and automated escrow, reducing the need for intermediaries.
- **Seamless Data Integration**: Oracle integration enables off-chain data to interact with on-chain components.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, OpenZeppelin
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Flask, Oracle
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor for price prediction)
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS
- **Development Tools**: Truffle, Ganache, Hardhat, MetaMask

## System Architecture

1. **Frontend**: A React-based interface that allows users to view and list properties. MetaMask is used for wallet integration.
2. **Backend**: A Flask server hosts the machine learning model for property price prediction.
3. **Blockchain Layer**: Smart contracts manage property tokenization, escrow handling, and ownership transfers.
4. **Storage**: IPFS stores property metadata, ensuring decentralized access to property information.
5. **Oracle Integration**: Oracles enable the platform to fetch and validate external data, supporting dynamic, real-time interactions between off-chain data and the blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.8+
- Hardhat for smart contract testing
- MetaMask browser extension for Ethereum wallet
- IPFS node or Infura for decentralized storage

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-real-estate-marketplace.git
    cd decentralized-real-estate-marketplace
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    - Frontend:
      ```bash
      cd client
      npm install
      ```
    - Backend:
      ```bash
      cd server
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3. **Smart Contracts**
    - Deploy the smart contracts using Truffle:
      ```bash
      truffle migrate --network development
      ```

4. **Start IPFS Node** (or use an IPFS gateway like Infura if not hosting your own node).

5. **Run the Backend**
    ```bash
    cd server
    python3 server.py
    ```

6. **Run the Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

1. **Listing a Property**: Enter property details and upload relevant files. The property data is stored on IPFS, and an NFT representing the property is minted on the blockchain.
2. **Price Prediction**: The platform’s AI predicts the property price based on input features, aiding in decision-making.
3. **Escrow and Purchase**: The buyer initiates the purchase, locking funds in escrow until the conditions of the sale are met. Upon completion, ownership is transferred to the buyer.

## Smart Contracts

- **RealEstate.sol**: Manages NFT minting and approval for transfers.
- **Escrow.sol**: Handles the escrow mechanism, ensuring secure transfer of funds and ownership upon transaction completion.
  
### Security Features

- **Ownership Transfers**: Uses secure, atomic transfers to avoid incomplete transactions.
- **Escrow Mechanism**: Ensures that funds are only released when conditions are met, reducing counterparty risk.
